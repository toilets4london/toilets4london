      <p>Toilets4London will be a mobile app to help people out and about in London easily
        find toilets. By working with local authorities, parks and public transport,
        Toilets4London will collect accurate data about publicly accessible toilets
        in London and display it in an easy to use way.</p>

      <p>Toilets4London will make it easy for toilet owners who require additional funding
        to maintain the facilities to charge a small access fee through the app.
        At Toilets4London, we are going to reverse the pattern of public toilet closures across London
        and enable people to access cleaner and more numerous toilets across the city.</p>
