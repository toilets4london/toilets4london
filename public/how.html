    <h2>Will the app be free to use?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, Toilets4London will be a free app. You will be able to search and locate free publicly accessible
      toilets all over London including public toilets, toilets in parks, the underground, some pubs, shopping centres
      etc. However you will also have the option to access toilets in restaurants and cafes for a small fee,
      for situations when there are no free toilets nearby. </p>
    <h2>How will Toilets4London get businesses to sign up?</h2>
    <p>First of all, it's important to realise that many businesses such as pubs have been
      letting passers-by use their facilities for free for a long time. This is an excellent
      way to contribute to the local community and we highly encourage businesses to open their
      toilets for free. However, this is also not a viable option in many situations, hence why
      we plan to develop an easy-to-use one time passcode system so that app users can generate
      a pass to access a toilet in a private business for a small fee.
    </p>
    <h2>How will the payment system work?</h2>
    <p>By linking the app to your credit card details, you will be able to purchase a ‘toilet pass’
      that you can show to someone at the relevant establishment before being allowed to use their toilet.
      The pass will include a one-time passcode that will be easily verifiable by anyone at the
      establishment.</p>
    <h2>How can my business sign up?</h2>
    <p>
      If your business is currently already letting the public use your toilets for free, please
      reach out to us at nina@toilets4london.com and we will ensure that your toilet is included
      in the first iteration of the app, which will only include free toilets.
      If your business is unable to check whether people using the toilet are paying customers
      or have a valid pass, please consider simply listing your toilet as a free toilet.
      You probably have people ‘sneaking in’ to use the facilities already and so this is
      your chance to play your part in breaking the stigma and contribute to the local community by
      providing accurate data about your toilet and officially signing up to the open toilets scheme.
      If you are intereted in offerring access to your toilet for a small fee, feel free to
      contact us, however please bear in mind that the in-app payment system is likely to be released
      later in the year</p>
