        <h2>Who is behind Toilets4London?</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Nina - founder of Toilets4London, Biomedical Engineering student at Imperial College, Software
            Engineering enthusiast and avid explorer of London. As someone
            who loves walking and exploring areas of London by foot, the problem of finding a toilet is something I
            encounter
            all too often. I am passionate about breaking the stigma around toilet-related issues in urban areas and
            believe that
            providing adequate toilet options to Londoners will go a long way to encouraging and enabling more active
            modes of transport.
        </p>
        <p>
            Toilets4London will be collaborating with the Greater London Authority as well as recieving help and advice
            from Softwire, a London based
            bespoke software development company. Feel free to reach out if you would like to help in any way and make
            London
            a more open, hygienic and accessible city.
        </p>
