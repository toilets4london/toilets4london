          <h1>Why was Toilets4London founded?</h1>
          <p>Finding a clean, open and accessible toilet near you should not be a challenge in the 21st century. 
              However, not only are public toilets decreasing in number due to lack of funding, 
              many people are deterred from using public toilets altogether due to valid concerns 
              around hygiene and safety. Simultaneously, we have a large number of toilets in privately 
              owned businesses such as pubs and restaurants which are usually only available to paying customers.
               By encouraging businesses to open up their toilets, collating accurate data on all existing 
               publicly accessible toilets in London and establishing a feedback loop between public 
               toilet owners and users, Toilets4London will make London a more open, dignified and healthy city.

            According to a 2018 survey by the Royal Society of Public Health, three in four of the UK public 
            think there are not enough public toilets in their area. This same study found that as many as one in 
            five people are deterred from going outside due to their anxiety around finding a toilet and this proportion is 
            much higher among women, the elderly and those with bladder or bowel conditions. With COVID-19 
            reshaping how we move and interact in public spaces, it is time to recognise the importance of 
            toilets to the equitable, dignified and healthy participation in public life. The economic and 
            societal benefits of adequate toilet provisions have never been clearer.</p>
